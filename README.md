# Problem Statement
As a web designer, we love to create Figma designs and then code them into reality. But, sometimes, while working on group projects with a close deadline, it is not always possible to spend time brainstorming for UI inspirations. We need to work on the Excalidraw-based wireframes themselves. Due to this, frontend developers are restricted to their thoughts and creativity to make the project possible. To save time and to not hardcode components from scratch, UI Component Libraries are needed.

# Our USP (Unique Selling Point)
